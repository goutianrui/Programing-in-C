# Programing-in-C
Some basic programs for those who just start learn C
It is a Library-Mangerment-System in C program. Actually I finished it in 2015 when I was in the first year of my college.
Very simple functions to add, delete, search books. And there is no DB with the program, I used files instead. 
Something You Should Know.
1 the program will create a folder in your disk at E:\book_stack
2 You'd better read the code before you use it for a trick.
